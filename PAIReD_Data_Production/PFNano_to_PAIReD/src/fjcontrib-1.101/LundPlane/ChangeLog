	* NEWS:
	* FJCONTRIB.cfg:
	preparing 2.1.2 release

2024-12-11  Gregory Soyez  <soyez@fastjet.fr>

	* AUTHORS:
	updated to reflect current maintainers (w Gavin and Matteo)

	* FJCONTRIB.cfg:           *** ADDED ***
	* VERSION:               *** REMOVED ***
	replaced the VERSION file with the new syntax which is a
	"version" line in FJCONTRIB.cfg

	* LundGenerator.cc:
	* LundWithSecondary.cc:
	* RecursiveLundEEGenerator.cc:
	* SecondaryLund.cc:
	* example.cc:
	* example_dpsi_collinear.cc:
	* example_dpsi_slice.cc:
	* example_secondary.cc:
	* Makefile:
	updated source code and build script to reflect the header
	relocation

	* LundEEHelpers.hh            -> include/fastjet/contrib/LundEEHelpers.hh
	* LundGenerator.hh            -> include/fastjet/contrib/LundGenerator.hh
	* LundJSON.hh                 -> include/fastjet/contrib/LundJSON.hh
	* LundWithSecondary.hh        -> include/fastjet/contrib/LundWithSecondary.hh
	* RecursiveLundEEGenerator.hh -> include/fastjet/contrib/RecursiveLundEEGenerator.hh
	* SecondaryLund.hh            -> include/fastjet/contrib/SecondaryLund.hh
	moved installed headers to the include/fastjet/contrib/ directory

2024-12-09 Mon  <gavin.salam@physics.ox.ac.uk>

	* Makefile:
	fixed a bug in the `fastjet-config --libs` call, adding --plugins so that
	one gets a consistent set of plugin libraries according to the
	specific fastjet configuration.

2024-02-28  Gregory Soyez  <soyez@fastjet.fr>

	* example_dpsi_collinear.cc:  fixed maybe-uninitialized gcc warnings

2024-01-18 Ludo Scyboz (+ minor contribs from Gregory Soyez + Gavin Salam)

	* RecursiveLundEEGenerator.hh:
	* example_dpsi_collinear.ref:
	* example_dpsi_slice.ref:
	* python/gen-test-event.py:
	* NEWS:
	another bug-fix for opposite hemispheres differences of psibar, where
	a missing sign needed to be added in the second hemisphere. This
	changes the reference files for opposite hemisphere dpsibar. For 
	same-hemisphere dpsibar, the sign can change (depending on the hemisphere). 
	Also updated python/gen-test-event.py  to have command-line options
	for more flexibility in examining output and for testing explanation
	of psibar absolute value in RecursiveLundEEGenerator comments.

2024-01-10  Gavin Salam + Alexander Karlberg

	* NEWS: 
	* VERSION:
	preparing for release 2.1.0 (NEWS still needs correct date to be added)

    * AUTHORS:
	added publication info for soft spin paper

2024-01-10  Gavin Salam + Ludo Scyboz + Alexander Karlberg

	* LundEEHelpers.hh:
	extended the comments in the signed_angle_between_planes function

	* RecursiveLundEEGenerator.hh:
	changed definition of psibar, which fixes a bug in differences
	of psibar values between opposite hemispheres. Differences
	within a same hemisphere should stay the same.

	* example_dpsi_collinear.cc:
	added extra output showing the primary declustering in the 
	second hemisphere. Also eliminated deprecated
	dynamic_psi_reference argument in setting up the RecursiveLundEEGenerator.

	* example_dpsi_collinear.ref:
	* example_dpsi_slice.ref:
	updated these reference files so that are consistent with 
	the new definition of psibar. Note the delta psibar values
	do not change. The collinear reference has acquired extra
	output showing a primary declustering in the second hemisphere. 

	* python/gen-test-event.py: *** ADDED ***
	small script to generate test events for verifying output from
	example_dpsi_collinear.ref

2024-01-08  Gavin Salam  <gavin.salam@physics.ox.ac.uk>

	* example_dpsi_slice.cc:
	replaced a uint -> unsigned int, to resolve a compilation issue
	with gcc-13 on MacOS

2023-09-22 Fri  <gavin.salam@physics.ox.ac.uk>

	* NEWS:
	* VERSION:
	preparing 2.0.4 release

	* RecursiveLundEEGenerator.hh:
	fixed const issue in in ternal lambda function (reported by Seryubin Seraphim)

	* LundPlane.hh: *** ADDED ***
	added this to provide a generic include for the main classes
	(absence of such a standard-looking reported by Seryubin Seraphim)

2022-10-04  Gregory Soyez  <soyez@fastjet.fr>

	* example.cc:
	* example_secondary.cc:
	* example_dpsi_collinear.cc:
	* example_dpsi_slice.cc:
	removed (harmless) compilation warnings (+ minor uniformisation
	of indentation)

	* VERSION:
	* NEWS:
	prepared for release 2.0.3

	* EEHelpers.hh ->  LundEEHelpers.hh:
	EEHelpers.hh was not being installed; given that it's a potentially 
	common name, renamed it before including among the installation 
	targets. 

	Also placed whole contents in a new contrib::lund_plane namespace,
	because of certain potentially common names like cross_product

	* Makefile:
	replaced EEHelpers.hh ->  LundEEHelpers.hh and made sure that
	LundEEHelpers.hh gets installed (without which RecursiveLundEEGenerator.hh
	cannot be used)

	* example_dpsi_collinear.cc:
	* example_dpsi_slice.cc:
	use of things from LundEEHelpers.hh updated to use of new namespace

	* RecursiveLundEEGenerator.hh:
	* RecursiveLundEEGenerator.cc:
	updated to use LundEEHelpers.hh (and associated namespace); 
	also added a (protected) default constructor to LundEEDeclustering

	* VERSION:
	* NEWS:
	prepared for release 2.0.2

	* Makefile:

	added #include <limits>, as per request from Andy Buckley
	for compilation with g++-12 on some systems
