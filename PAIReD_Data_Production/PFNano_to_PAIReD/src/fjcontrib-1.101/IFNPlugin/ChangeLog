	* FJCONTRIB.cfg:
	* NEWS:
	Preparing release of 1.0.4

	* Makefile:
	removed spurious dependency on RecursiveTools, left over
	from dependency testing

	* FJCONTRIB.cfg:
	* NEWS:
	Preparing release of 1.0.3

2024-12-10 Thu  <gavin.salam@physics.ox.ac.uk> (with Matteo)

	* FJCONTRIB.cfg:
	added "minimal_fastjet_version: 3.4.1" given support
	for this requirement now available in fjcontrib.
	Upped version to 1.0.3-alpha3, to be consistent
	with the versioning of the original git repo

2024-12-10 Tue  <gavin.salam@physics.ox.ac.uk>

	* Renamed this contrib as IFNPlugin:
	since FJContrib now supports dependencies, it is now feasible for
	each group's flavour code to live in a separate contrib and for them
	to depend on the IFNPlugin contrib for its common infrastructure
	(JetFlav). 

	* *.hh -> include/fastjet/contrib/*.hh:

	* FJCONTRIB.cfg:
	updated version number to 1.0.0-alpha2
	[NB: this was inconsistent with the git repo, fixed
	subsequently; should have been 1.0.3-alpha2]

2024-05-21 Tue  <gavin.salam@physics.ox.ac.uk>

	* FlavNeutraliser.cc:
	* IFNPlugin.cc:
	* IFNPlugin.hh:

	Removed some of the default arguments from the old IFNPlugin
	constructor to avoid it being used by mistake. Added several
	LimitedWarnings if old (deprecated or non-tested) measures are used.
	The description() output should now be a little more informative when
	non-standard measures are used.

	Moved "general" measure to be first in the in the pp
	FlavNeutraliser::neutralisation_distance switch statement, since
	it is the one most likely to be used.

	This mirrors git commit 6907232b in the original IFNPlugin git repo, 
	corresponding to tag 1.0.2

2024-03-19 Gavin:
	* [many files]:
	Initial creation and import of IFNPlugin version 1.0.1 from 
	https://github.com/jetflav/IFNPlugin (7673166d9dc)
